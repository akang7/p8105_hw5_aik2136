### Problem 1

Create a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants, including the subject ID, arm, and observations over time:

-   Start with a dataframe containing all file names; the `list.files` function will help
-   Iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using `purrr::map` and saving the result as a new variable in the dataframe

``` r
df_1 =
  tibble(filenames = list.files("data", full.names = TRUE), map(filenames, read_csv)) %>% 
  unnest() %>% 
  separate(filenames, into = c("arm", "id"), sep = "_") %>%
  mutate(arm = str_remove(arm, "data/"), id = str_remove(id, ".csv")) %>% 
  mutate(arm = recode(arm, "'con' = 'Control'; 'exp' = 'Experimental'"))
```

-   Tidy the result; manipulate file names to include control arm and subject ID, make sure weekly observations are “tidy”, and do any other tidying that’s necessary

``` r
tidy_df = df_1 %>% 
  gather(key = week, value = value, "week_1":"week_8") %>% 
  mutate(week = str_remove(week, "week_")) %>% 
  mutate(id = as.numeric(id), week = as.numeric(week))  %>%
  arrange(week, id)
```
