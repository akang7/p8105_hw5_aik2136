### Problem 1

Create a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants, including the subject ID, arm, and observations over time:

Start with a dataframe containing all file names; the `list.files` function will help

``` r
csv_names = list.files("./data/", full.names = TRUE)

df_1 = csv_names %>% 
  map(read_csv) 
```

Iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using `purrr::map` and saving the result as a new variable in the dataframe

``` r
for (i in 1:20) {
  if (i < 11) {
    df_1[[i]] = df_1[[i]] %>% 
      mutate(arm = "Control", 
             study_id = i)
  } else if (i > 10) {
    df_1[[i]] = df_1[[i]] %>% 
      mutate(arm = "Experimental", 
             study_id = i - 10)
  }
}
```

Tidy the result; manipulate file names to include control arm and subject ID, make sure weekly observations are “tidy”, and do any other tidying that’s necessary

``` r
df_tidy = bind_rows(df_1) %>% 
  gather(key = week, value = obs, week_1:week_8) %>% 
  arrange(week, study_id) %>% 
  separate(week, into = c("remove", "week")) %>% 
  select(-remove)
```
